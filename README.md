# BMIR Player for Android

This repo contains source code for the 2018 update of the *BMIR Player for Android*.

- This music player app was originally written to play the online music stream from Burning Man Information Radio (BMIR), available at http://bmir.org during the Burning Man event.  
- The 2018 update enhances the app to play the year-round music stream Shouting Fire, available at http://shoutingfire.com, during the rest of the year, and ShoutingFire will also stream BMIR during the event!
